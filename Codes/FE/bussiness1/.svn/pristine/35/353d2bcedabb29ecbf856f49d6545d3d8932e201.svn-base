# DEPRICATED

Babel has released a "packaged" version of their polyfill so this repo is no longer necessary or maintained.

* NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-polyfill
* GITHUB: https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-polyfill

## Browser Polyfill for Babel

I use bower as a dependency manager I have a large set of "widgets" have been created using Babel that are intended to be used in the browser. I needed to enforce that anytime somebody "bower install"'d one (or many) of these widgets that they would also get this browser polyfill. So I created this repo and have listed it as a dependency for all of my widgets.

I really hope that Babel in the future allows for a better way of doing this.
